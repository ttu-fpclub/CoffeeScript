This directory contains files with CoffeeScript in them.
CoffeeScript can be found at coffeescript.org
A nice collection of books is there.
In relation to functional programming is a book at http://autotelicum.github.io/Smooth-CoffeeScript/
This is a book which takes a lot of the work from the book Eloquent JavaScript, and translates it over to CoffeeScript.
You can see how to install CoffeeScript on any OS through the above mentioned website.
As usual all resources are free.
I hope you enjoy this language and can see some application in web programming through functional languages.
